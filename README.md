# The John Butler Trio

Front end only website built for Code Institutes Full Stack Web Development course (User Centric Front End module).

The John Butler Trio are an Australian roots/rock band. The band were chosen as the subject for this project due to their availability of a
varied selection of images, videos, music and color pallete to allow for greater flexibility in design.

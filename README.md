#The John Butler Trio

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Front end only website built for Code Institutes Full Stack Web Development course (User Centric Front End module).

The John Butler Trio are an Australian roots/rock band. The band were chosen as the subject for this project due to their availability of a
varied selection of images, videos, music and color pallete to allow for greater flexibility in design.

###UX

This website was created for two reasons:

1) The primary purpose of showcasing the skills I have learn't in the first 3 module of Code Institutes Full Stack Web Development course.

As an accessor you will be able to:

* See the 4 page front end website here (insert website url).
* View the code written behind the website here (insert gthub url).

2) This website, once deployed live, will provide any fans of The John Butler Trio with information relaiting to the band. 

As a fan of The John Butler Trio you will be able to:

* Keep up to date with the bands latest news such as tour dates, videos, photos, music etc (insert website url)
* Discover how the band originated and each band members story here (insert about.html)
* Contact the band for promotional or fan based queries (insert contact.html)
* See the bands activity on social media in the social networks section of the home page (insert index.html)

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

###Features

The website is made of 4 pages:

* Home page - General information about The John Butler Trio with latest news, videos, albums, tour dates and social posts.
* About page - Information on the bands origins as well as a brief bio on each of the band members.
* Music page - The latest albums with full playlists offered via spotify embed.
* Contact page - A contact form provided to contact the band for any promotional or fan based queries (back end to be added at a later date).

###Technologies Used

Tehnologies used in this project:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript and Jquery - used for dropdown menu (although not needed for assessment)

Frameworks used:

* Bootstrap (3.37) used for: 
    - Repsonsive grid layout
    - Navbar & dropdown menu
    - Some button styles

###Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
